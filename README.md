# IoT Vulnerability Exploitation and Verification Framework

This project is a vulnerability verification framework for various IoT devices. It collects, implements, and tests Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits for known vulnerabilities across multiple embedded platforms and device types. The purpose of this repository is to assist security researchers in analyzing and validating the security of real-world IoT devices.
